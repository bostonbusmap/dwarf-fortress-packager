dwarf-fortress-packager
=======================

A bit of scripting to make deb and RPM packages for Dwarf Fortress.

Much of the package metadata is autogenerated and is probably inaccurate. This creates packages that are for personal use to make installation cleaner.

This tool is provided without any warranty, in the hope that it is useful. It is not affiliated with Dwarf Fortress or Bay 12 Games at all.

Currently it's hardcoded to version 0.34.11 and its particular files. Eventually I want it to detect the version from the package or ask the user if that doesn't work.

Steps to create Debian package
==============================

* Ensure you have the `devscripts` package installed: `apt-get install devscripts`
* Download Dwarf Fortress for Linux: http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/
* Untar into `df_linux` directory
* Run `./makedeb.sh`

This has only been tested on Ubuntu 12.10 so far.

RPM
===

* Ensure you have the appropriate packages to build rpms. (On Ubuntu this comes with the rpm package.)
* Download Dwarf Fortress for Linux: http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/
* Untar into `df_linux` directory
* Run `./makerpm.sh`

This is completely untested.
